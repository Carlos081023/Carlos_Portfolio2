## User Story: Inventory Insights

A retail company specializing in office supplies, technology products, and furniture seeks to gain a deeper understanding of its inventory and demand. The management team aims to uncover specific insights across their three key departments to inform decision-making and guide future strategies.

Key Business Questions:

  * Which products drive the majority of sales and should be prioritized for stock replenishment?
  * Which items have low sales and may be candidates for discontinuation or promotional strategies?
  * What are the projected demand trends by month or season to optimize stock levels?

## Business Objectives

  * Analyze products based on revenue impact, helping prioritize inventory decisions.
  * Forecast future demand to anticipate stock needs and reduce the risk of stockouts during peak periods.
  * Provide actionable recommendations on inventory optimization and product recommendations 

## Data Collection
The dataset includes four CSV files: Orders, Customers, Products, and Location. The Orders file details transactions over five years (2018â€“2023). The Customers file contains customer information such as location and name, while the Products file lists all SKUs the company currently offers. The Location file includes address information within the United States.

## Data Cleaning

The dataset required processing and cleaning to ensure quality, focusing on:

  * Correcting text/spelling errors.
  * Standardizing labels, formats, and field lengths.
  * Removing duplicates.
  * Handling missing or blank values.

Data integrity is crucial to accurate analysis. The complete data cleaning process is documented in the data cleaning file attached.
